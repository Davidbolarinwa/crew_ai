# 🚀 Newsletter Crew Project 🚀

Welcome to the **Newsletter Crew Project**! This innovative Python application harnesses the power of AI to transform lists of URLs into captivating, concise summaries. Perfect for staying up-to-date with the latest AI advancements without wading through pages of content. 📚✨

## Getting Started 🌟

Before diving into the digital depths, let's ensure you have all the necessary tools and configurations to make the magic happen. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

### Prerequisites 🛠️

1. **Python**: Make sure Python 3.8 or later is installed on your system. Python is our magic wand 🪄 for running the script.
   - Download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: Our spellbook 📖 where we'll write and run our magical scripts.
   - Grab it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

3. **OpenAI API Key**: The secret sauce 🌶️ that adds intelligence to our script. You'll need an API key from OpenAI.
   - Sign up and get your key [here](https://openai.com/api/).

### Installation Guide 📌

#### Step 1: Clone the Potion Recipe (Clone the Repository)

```bash
git clone https://your-repository-url.git
cd newsletter-crew-project
```

#### Step 2: Install Python Packages 🐍

Cast the following spell in your terminal or command prompt to install the necessary Python packages:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pydantic crewai-tools
```

#### Step 3: Set Your OpenAI API Key 🔑

For our script to communicate with the grand library of OpenAI, you must set your API key. Replace `Your_OpenAI_API_Key_Here` with your actual OpenAI API key in the script or use environment variables for enhanced security:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='Your_OpenAI_API_Key_Here'
```

Or, directly in the script (not recommended for production):

```python
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "Your_OpenAI_API_Key_Here"
```

#### Step 4: Open Your Spellbook in VS Code 📖

Navigate to the project folder and open it in VS Code:

```bash
code .
```

### Running the Script 🏃

1. **Summon the Terminal in VS Code** (Ctrl+`, or use the View -> Terminal menu).
2. **Cast the Script** by typing:

```bash
python main.py
```

3. **Provide a URL** when prompted to summon the content you wish to summarize.

### How It Works 🔍

- **Step 1**: The script awakens and greets you, asking for a URL to summarize.
- **Step 2**: The `scraper` agent ventures out into the vast internet, collecting the essence of the provided URL using the `WebsiteSearchTool`.
- **Step 3**: The `writer` agent then takes this essence and crafts it into a compelling narrative, easy for all to understand, no matter how complex the original content.
- **Step 4**: Voilà! The result is presented, a concise and engaging summary of the content.

### Troubleshooting 🛠

- If you encounter dragons 🐉 (errors) related to missing packages, ensure all spells (commands) were cast correctly in the installation process.
- Should the OpenAI library seem to be in another castle 🏰, verify your API key and subscription status.

### Support 🆘
